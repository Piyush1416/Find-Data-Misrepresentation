# Find-Data-Misrepresentation

I am using Dataset collected through the Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS), which is an annual statewide telephone survey conducted by Company X's Survey Business Unit. This work has been commissioned by the head of the Survey Busines Unit(SBU), and is aimed at creating a mechanism for detecting misrepresentation in the survey data set.

The critical issue is that the SBU believes that the validity of the survey data may be compromised as some respondents may intentionally misrepresent their health status for Diabetes. In-order to solve that, we will be conducting preliminary survey using data exploration and then conduct predictive analysis using ML algorithms to find outliers which we suspect to be falsely represented.

I will be breaking down my analysis into following steps:

1] Data Exploration

2] Feature Selection

3] Hypothesis Validation

4] Predictive Analysis





For now I will be using Following Machine Learning Algorithms:

A] k-Means Clustering - for preliminary data analysis to find data discrepancy

B] SVM Classification for predictive analysis

C] Random Forest for predictive analysis
